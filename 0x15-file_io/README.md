This is a directory in the repo that basically deals with file input and output also
known as FILE I/O.

in this directory and task you get to find out how files are created,
closed and all th other a aspects that deal with files like writing,
reading and opening.

I shall be very glad to diversify the README to accommodate and explain
more on the file details in each file
